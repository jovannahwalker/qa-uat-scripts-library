## Severity Levels

| Severity  | Definition                              | Example                               |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Critical  | System crash or complete failure      | Website down, data loss              |
| Major     | Core functionality broken             | Payment fails during checkout       |
| Minor     | Non-critical issue with workaround    | UI misalignment, typo in label      |
| Trivial   | Cosmetic or very low impact issue     | Color mismatch, small typo          |

## Priority Levels

| Priority  | Definition                    | Example                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| High      | Must be fixed immediately     | Checkout button broken          |
| Medium    | Fix soon, but not urgent      | Incorrect tooltip text          |
| Low       | Fix if time permits           | Minor UI alignment issues       |

**Note:**  
Severity reflects the impact of the bug on the system, while priority indicates how soon it should be fixed.
