## Tips for Effective Bug Reports

- **Be Clear and Concise:** Use simple language and avoid ambiguity.  
- **Reproduce Steps:** List exact steps to reproduce the bug, so others can replicate it.  
- **Include Environment Details:** Specify browser, OS, app version, and environment (QA/UAT/Prod).  
- **Describe Expected vs. Actual Results:** Clearly state what should happen and what actually happened.  
- **Attach Evidence:** Screenshots, screen recordings, and log files can be very helpful.  
- **Use Proper Severity & Priority:** Classify bugs correctly to help with triaging.  
- **Avoid Vague Descriptions:** Phrases like "It doesn't work" or "It's broken" aren't helpful. Be specific.  
- **Link Related Tickets:** Reference any related issues or previous bugs.
